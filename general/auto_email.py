Hi {},

My name is Sean and I am a new graduate student at BYU researching in computer science and machine learning. Specifically, I have done work in computer vision, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Chris Spencer works with one of my professors and told me about your research at Adobe in {}. I find this really interesting and I think that my background could be well suited for this.

I applied through research at Adobe, but I was particularly interested in your work and wanted to reach out ot you personally so you know who I am. Attached is a copy of my resume and you can see more at my personal site seanwade.com. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to talk.

Thanks,

Sean Wade
